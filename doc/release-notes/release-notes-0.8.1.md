How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait
until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older
versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over
<<<<<<< HEAD
/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).
=======
/Applications/BitNova-Qt (on Mac) or bitnovad/bitnova-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you
run 0.8.1 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take
anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of
your machine.
